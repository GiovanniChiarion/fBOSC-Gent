# fBOSC-Gent

fBOSCElaboration.m is a Matlab script written to analyse EEG data in newdata folder.
Data is organized in a fieldtrip structure (FieldTrip package is necessary to perform preprocessing tasks).
The subject has a mechanical stimulation frequency in his fingers after the cue (time: 0s) of 40 Hz, the goal is to identify where this frequency can be spotted in the EEG data using the fBOSC algorithm.
